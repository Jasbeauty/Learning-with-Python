Over the years, I have learned that you can go much farther with a team than you can go alone. The Right Thought plus the Right People in the Right Environment at the Right Time for the Right Reason = the Right Result.

If you want your thoughts to make an impact, you need to land them with others so that they can someday be implemented.Landing thoughts with the people on the firing line will give you great insight. 

No matter what you choose to do, go to your thinking place, take paper and pen, and make sure you capture your ideas in writing.

Act on Your Good Thoughts ,Think things through —then follow through.

You cannot wait until you feel like thinking to do it. However, I’ve found that once you engage in the process of good thinking, you can use your emotions to feed the process and create mental momentum.

Success comes to those who have an entire mountain of gold that they continually mine, not those who find one nugget and try to live on it for fifty years. To become someone who can mine a lot of gold, you need to keep repeating the process of good thinking.
