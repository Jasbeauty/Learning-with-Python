How Successful People Think !

Good thinkers solve problems, they never lack ideas that can build an organization, and they always have hope for a better future. 

When something intrigues you, whether it’s someone else’s idea or the seed of an idea that you’ve come up with yourself, keep it in front of you. Put it in writing and keep it somewhere in your favorite thinking place to stimulate your thinking.
